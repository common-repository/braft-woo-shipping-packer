== Description ==
Woocommerce addon to calculate shipping costs from a list of containers and a list of dimension/weight based thresholds.
The addon works only with flat rates, so first configure your flat rates for every zone and shipping company.
Then you may start working with Packer.
It does not matter what price you enter for the flat rates, the Packer will overwrite them and provide accurate shipping costs for your client.
There is also a feature to create a backup copy of all the settings in the form of a json file, and txt file for reference.

== Installation ==
After installing the plugin from plugins section visit Packer tab in Woocommerce->Settings section.
